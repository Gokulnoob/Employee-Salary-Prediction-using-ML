PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current Industry Challenges:

• Salary determination in organizations lacks standardization and transparency
• HR departments struggle with fair compensation decisions due to subjective biases
• Employees face uncertainty about their market value and career growth potential
• Companies need data-driven approaches to remain competitive in talent acquisition
• Traditional methods rely on manual evaluation which is time-consuming and inconsistent
• Need for automated system that can predict salaries based on multiple factors

OBJECTIVE: Develop an intelligent machine learning system that can accurately predict employee salaries to ensure fair compensation and support HR decision-making.
