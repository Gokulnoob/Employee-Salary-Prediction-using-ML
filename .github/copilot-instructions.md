# Employee Salary Prediction Project Instructions

This is a machine learning project for predicting employee salaries. The project uses Python with scikit-learn, pandas, and other ML libraries.

## Project Structure:

- `data/`: Contains datasets (raw and processed)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation
- `src/`: Python source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- `models/`: Trained model files and evaluation results

## Key Guidelines:

- Use pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Use scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Follow proper ML pipeline: data preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → evaluation
- Include proper data validation and error handling
- Use matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization
- Document all functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
